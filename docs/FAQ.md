## Troubleshooting

### 11. Why is my download failing?

Common reasons:

- **Age-restricted content**: Some videos require authentication we can't provide
- **Private videos**: We can only download public videos
- **Region-locked content**: Videos restricted to certain countries may not work
- **Video removed**: The video may have been deleted by the uploader

### 12. Why is my 4K download slow?

4K videos are large files (several GB). Download speed depends on:

- Your internet connection
- Server load
- Video length

For faster downloads, try 1080p which offers great quality with smaller file sizes.

### 13. The progress bar is stuck at "Merging" - what does this mean?

After downloading video and audio streams separately, we merge them into a single file. This process can take a moment for larger files - please be patient!

### 14. Why can't I download some videos?

Some videos have restrictions:

- Age-restricted (18+)
- Geo-blocked
- Private or unlisted
- Removed or unavailable

## Technical Questions

We use yt-dlp, a powerful open-source tool, to fetch video metadata and streams directly from YouTube. The video is downloaded to our server, processed, and then streamed to your browser for download.

No. Videos are immediately deleted from our servers after you download them. We don't keep any copies of the content you download.

### 17. What about subtitles/transcripts?

Yes! We offer transcript downloads in SRT format. If available, you can download subtitles in the video's original language or auto-generated subtitles.

### 18. Can I use this on mobile?

Yes! Our website is fully responsive and works on all devices - phones, tablets, and computers. For the best mobile experience, we recommend using desktop mode in your browser.
