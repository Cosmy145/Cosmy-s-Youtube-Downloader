_Last Updated: January 2026_

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Cosmy's YouTube Downloader is designed with privacy as a core principle. We believe in transparency and want you to understand exactly what data we collect (spoiler: almost none!).

---

## 1. Information We DO NOT Collect

### We do NOT collect, store, or track:

- ❌ **URLs you download** - We don't log video URLs
- ❌ **Downloaded content** - Videos are deleted immediately after download
- ❌ **Personal information** - No names, emails, or accounts required
- ❌ **IP addresses** - We don't track your location or identity
- ❌ **Cookies for tracking** - No advertising or analytics cookies
- ❌ **Browser fingerprints** - No device identification
- ❌ **Download history** - No records of what you've downloaded
- ❌ **Usage patterns** - No behavioral analytics

## 2. Information We Process Temporarily

### During a download session:

Some information is temporarily processed in memory (RAM) to provide the service:

| Data              | Purpose                 | Retention                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Video URL         | To fetch content        | Deleted after download                     |
| Video metadata    | To display info         | Memory only, not saved                     |
| Temporary files   | For processing          | Deleted immediately after streaming to you |
| Quality selection | To fetch correct format | Not stored                                 |

**Key Point**: All temporary data exists only during your active download session and is never written to persistent storage.

## 3. How Your Downloads Work

### Step-by-step privacy breakdown:

1. **You paste a URL** → Sent to our server via encrypted HTTPS
2. **We fetch metadata** → Retrieved from YouTube, not stored
3. **You choose quality** → Selection processed in memory only
4. **Download begins** → Video downloaded to temporary storage
5. **Streamed to you** → File sent directly to your browser
6. **Cleanup** → Temporary files automatically deleted

**Total time data exists on our servers**: Only during active download (seconds to minutes)
